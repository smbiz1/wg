Traefik certificates on Tailscale
=================================

[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/) simplifies networking complexity while designing, deploying, and operating applications. Starting with the release of [Traefik Proxy 3.0 Beta 1](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v300-beta1-2022-12-05), Traefik Proxy supports Tailscale. When Traefik gets an HTTPS request for a `*.ts.net` site, it gets the HTTPS certificate from the machine's local Tailscale daemon.

No configuration is required for the certificate.

For example, you can define a certificate resolver in the [static configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/configuration-overview/#the-static-configuration), and it automatically enables HTTPS:

[YAML](https://tailscale.com/kb/1234/traefik-certificates?tab=yaml)[TOML](https://tailscale.com/kb/1234/traefik-certificates?tab=toml)[CLI](https://tailscale.com/kb/1234/traefik-certificates?tab=cli)

```shell
[certificatesResolvers.myresolver.tailscale]
```

Then, for each router or entrypoint where you want to use it, explicitly reference the resolver in the [dynamic configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/configuration-overview/#the-dynamic-configuration):

[YAML](https://tailscale.com/kb/1234/traefik-certificates?tab=yaml)[TOML](https://tailscale.com/kb/1234/traefik-certificates?tab=toml)

```shell
[http]
  [http.routers]
    [http.routers.routertailscale]
      service = "myservice"
      rule = "Host(`example.foo.ts.net`) && Path(`/tailscale`)"
      [http.routers.routertailscale.tls]
        certResolver = "tailscale"

  [http.services]
    [http.services.myservice.loadBalancer]
      [[http.services.myservice.loadBalancer.servers]]
         url = "http://localhost:6060"
```
